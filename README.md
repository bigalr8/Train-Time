# Train-Time
Firebase and Moment.js Assignment using Train Schedule

App accepts train schedule entries, places them in a Firebase database and retrieves them for listing in a schedule. 
The app should determine the time of the next train to arrive, based on the initial daily departure and the specified frequency for it.
This sould be accomplished using the Moment.js date and time processing javascript library. 

I was not able to sucessfully calculate the next arrovqal time using Momenent.
